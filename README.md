#Installation 

The current Linux installation packages (x64 only) are divided into three parts and needs to be installed in the fallowing order: 
  
    1. Intel SGX driver 
    2. Intel SGX platform software (PSW) 
    3. Intel SGX SDK. 

To install the driver, PSW and SDK you need root privileges.

To install the SGX driver without ECDSA attestation: 
  1. Download Intel SGX driver package from 
    
    https://download.01.org/intel-sgx/latest/linux-latest/distro/ubuntu20.04-server/
  
  2. Run the following command: 
    
    $ sudo ./sgx_linux_x64_driver.bin

To install the Intel SGX PSW (from the repository): 
  1. Add the repository to your sources. 
    
    $ echo 'deb [arch=amd64] https://- download.01.org/intel-sgx/sgx_repo/ubuntu focalâ€¨main' | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/intel-sgx.list 
    
  2. Add the key to trusted keys: 
    
    $ wget -qO - https://download.01.org/intel-sgx/sgx_ repo/ubuntu/intel-sgx-deb.key | sudo apt-key add - 
    
  3. Update apt and install the packages: 
    
    $ sudo apt update 

  launch service:
      
      $ sudo apt install libsgx-launch libsgx-urts 
      
  EPID-based attestation service:
      
      $ sudo apt install libsgx-epid libsgx-urts 

  algorithm agnostic attestation service:
      
      $ sudo apt install libsgx-quote-ex libsgx-urts 

To install the Intel SGX SDK 
  1. Download Intel SGX SDK package: sgx_linux_x64_sdk_<version>.bin from 
    
    https://download.01.org/intel-sgx/latest/linux-latest/distro/ubuntu20.04-server/
  
  2. Install the SDK using the following command: 
    
    $ ./sgx_linux_x64_sdk_<version>.bin 
  
  3. After the installation, the SGX SDK package is installed into the directory [User Input Path]/sgxsdk
    
  Run the command 
      
      $ source [User Input Path]/sgxsdk/environment 
      
  to set all environment variables. 
    
  4. Download the mitigation tools that are named as.ld.objdump.gold.r2.tar.gz from 
  
    https://download.01.org/intel-sgx/latest/linux-latest/
    
  unzip them and copy the tools to the directory of /usr/local/bin.
